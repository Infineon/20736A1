/// BleAppFwu implements firmware update.
/*! This provides a few methods to be called from the App to
    implement the Firmware Upgrade protocol.

    The protocol is very simple:
    - Host can Read EEPROM/ParallelFlash/SerialFlash any time by
        - Read ( SETUP_READ +  READ)

    - However Write and Erase (firmware upgrade) need to enabled first by sending an ENABLE_FWU .
    Once enabled, the host can:
    - Read (SETUP_READ + READ) memory, including EEPROM and Flash.
    - Write (WRITE), including EEPROM at 0xFFxxxxxx
    - Launch (make a call to a given address, with the usual "bit 0 == thumb"
    - Erase (memset 0xFF, on IRAM only right now)

    As soon ENABLE_FWU was enabled, a watchdog timer is started (default 10
    seconds). Every accepted FWU command restarts it; if it's
    let expire, we reset the system to get out of any issue (e.g. the
    host hangs or we lose the link).

    Based on these primitives, the host can perform almost any
    update.
